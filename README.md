# UICollectionView Tutorial

Hey folks! 

I needed to learn the collection view for my QuizApp project. I made a little tutorial. On the first screen, you can see the student names in the cells. 
I created a class list using the collection view logic. When the student names are clicked, it redirects to the detail page. While doing this, 
I also learned the navigation controller.

The class list looks like this:
